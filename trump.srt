1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,736
The President: Thank you
very much for being here,

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,705
for the incredible work
you're doing to help us

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:09,776
pass the really
historic tax cuts.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,544
There's never been
anything like this

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,646
in the history
of our country.

6
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:16,116
It's cuts and it's relief
and it's also reform.

7
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,919
And frankly, it's also
simplification.

8
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:21,521
So, we're covering
everything.

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,258
There has never been
anything like it,

10
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,092
and it's so important.

11
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,694
The economy
is doing very well

12
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,728
but it can do
much better.

13
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,231
A lot of jobs are going
to come from this

14
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,766
and a lot of companies
are going to start

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,434
pouring back
into the United States.

16
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,903
In fact, we're going to
be announcing one big one

17
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,472
sometime very shortly --

18
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,707
a very big one
coming back

19
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,975
into the United States.

20
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,611
All of you have done
a tremendous job

21
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,779
mobilizing your members,

22
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,680
talking to the members
of Congress,

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,016
which is very important,
and making a strong case

24
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,385
for tax reform
in the media.

25
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,089
The media
is not all fake,

26
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,225
so therefore we can
get a fair shake.

27
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,595
Now is the time
to redouble our efforts.

28
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,997
Your country
needs you now more

29
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:04,864
than ever before.

30
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,866
You are leaders
of this country

31
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,903
and certainly leaders
on this subject

32
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,371
and you know more
about it than anybody.

33
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,442
We need you to be united,
committed, and proactive

34
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,578
in order to overcome
the forces fighting.

35
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,914
And there are forces
fighting out there

36
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,818
that very much benefit
by the way it is now,

37
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,119
but that's bad
for the country.

38
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,520
They know that

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,855
but they're fighting
for themselves;

40
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,156
they're not fighting
for the country.

41
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,459
In a few days, I'll be
traveling to Asia

42
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,027
to advance
America's economic

43
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,696
and national security
priorities.

44
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,733
I am counting on all
of you to be back here,

45
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,303
working to maintain
our momentum

46
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,605
on tax reform
and tax cuts.

47
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,374
And that will be
a short period of time --

48
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,777
I'll be away for about
ten and a half days,

49
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,345
and we'll get back
very quickly.

50
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:56,883
We're meeting in China,
in South Korea, in Japan.

51
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:57,851
We're going to Vietnam.

52
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,819
We're going to
the Philippines,

53
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,088
which is a strategically
important location

54
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,756
where the previous
administration

55
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,991
was not exactly welcome,

56
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,326
as you probably remember.

57
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,362
The Democrats will say
our tax bill

58
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,531
is for the rich,
but they know it's not.

59
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,266
And what they will do
is --

60
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,567
they don't even know
the tax bill.

61
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,737
The tax bill hasn't even
been really put out yet.

62
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,039
It will be over the next
short period of time.

63
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,141
But they immediately say,
oh,

64
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,276
it's for the rich,
it's for the rich --

65
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,511
because that's
the right thing to say,

66
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,212
I mean, for them.

67
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,747
But it doesn't work,
and they know that.

68
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,415
In fact, I think we'll
have some Democrats

69
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,485
doing this and voting for
us for the reduced taxes

70
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,287
because it's a tax bill
for middle class;

71
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,689
it's a tax bill for jobs,

72
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,024
it's going to bring
a lot of companies in;

73
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,626
and it's a tax bill
for business,

74
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,494
which is going
to create the jobs.

75
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,630
We're bringing it down --
from 35 down to 20.

76
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,233
While I'm in Asia,
members of my Cabinet

77
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,035
will be traveling
all around the country

78
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,703
talking directly
to taxpayers

79
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,007
and focusing
on the regional media,

80
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,075
which we find to be a
much more credible media,

81
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,343
to be honest with you.

82
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,779
In fact, I found it
to be incredible

83
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,014
how good they are.

84
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,049
Of course, Secretary
Mnuchin, Director Cohn,

85
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,450
and my entire
economic team

86
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,986
will remain totally
focused on tax reform.

87
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,622
They'll be staying here

88
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,425
and will continue to work
closely with all of you.

89
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,726
They've had
a great relationship

90
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,028
with most of the people
in the room.

91
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,064
We need your continued
input to make sure

92
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,501
that the final bill gets
all of the details right

93
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,170
and that we get
that approval.

94
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,673
I want the House to pass
a bill by Thanksgiving.

95
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,009
I want all of the people
standing by my side

96
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,112
when we get ready
to sign by Christmas.

97
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,314
Hopefully before
Christmas,

98
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,649
you'll all be in the room

99
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,184
standing
front row center.

100
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,552
I think we'll be able
to find a place

101
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,821
where you can all
stand front row center.

102
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,356
It will be a big event.

103
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,624
It will be
the biggest tax event

104
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,060
in the history
of our country.

105
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,494
Thank you all for
being here today.

106
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,229
We have a couple of folks

107
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,365
that I'd like to have say
maybe a couple of words

108
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,367
while we're
with the media.

109
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,869
Tom Donohue has been
President and CEO of U.S.

110
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:58,271
Chamber of Commerce
for a long time.

111
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,473
Tom, do you have
anything to say?

112
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,941
Mr. Donohue: Well,
thank you very much

113
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,409
for having this meeting,
Mr. President.

114
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,477
The President: Thank you,
Tom.

115
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,845
Mr. Donohue: The business
community has been

116
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,081
waiting a long time

117
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,684
for an administration
and the President

118
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,286
and a willing Congress

119
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,923
to do what we haven t
done for many decades.

120
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,192
And we think

121
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:24,097
we were lucky
to arrange a budget,

122
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,565
but we're going to have

123
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,300
a better opportunity
in the Senate.

124
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,436
I think you're right,
there are some members

125
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,806
of the
Democratic legislature

126
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,409
that will come around
on some of this,

127
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,611
particularly
if the numbers

128
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,879
are as they promised.

129
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,316
And you hit it
right on the head

130
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,651
that we got
to work on it.

131
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,620
We're going to have
some differences

132
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,122
amongst the
business community

133
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,891
on what should be the
takeaways and the adds.

134
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,093
But we just have
to work on it,

135
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,531
and I think your planning
is really quite good.

136
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,565
You're off to Asia

137
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,501
and everybody else
gets it worked out.

138
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,935
(Laughter)

139
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,270
The President: Next week,
we'll come back

140
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,471
and let's see
what we have, right?

141
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,339
(Laughter)

142
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,440
Well, I appreciate
it very much.

143
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,541
And what you said
is important --

144
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,076
we did get
the budget passed.

145
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,045
And as you know,
that was a big event

146
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,579
because that
doesn't often happen,

147
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,515
and we got it
fairly easily passed.

148
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,949
I think we had a couple
of extra votes

149
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,285
if we needed them,

150
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,054
and more than a couple of
votes if we needed them.

151
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,422
There's great spirit
for this.

152
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,957
The Republicans have
a tremendous spirit.

153
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,526
We'll have
no Democrat support.

154
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,927
We may have on
the tax cuts

155
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,530
because I think it's
going to be very hard

156
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,165
for five or six of them

157
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,399
to run successfully

158
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,801
saying they want
to raise taxes.

159
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,470
Look, the Democrats
want to raise taxes

160
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,072
and really
create obstruction.

161
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,674
And the Republicans
want to lower taxes,

162
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,342
so we want to get
rid of regulations.

163
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,345
I've gotten rid
of more regulations

164
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,181
in the first nine months

165
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,451
than any President has
for their term in office.

166
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,686
That's a big statement.

167
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,822
But we've really
just begun.

168
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,025
I would say we have at
least another 50 percent

169
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,693
that we want to do.

170
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,495
So that's going
to be fantastic.

171
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,197
In some cases,
it's statutory.

172
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,398
We have to give a notice,

173
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,799
and then you have
to give another notice,

174
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,434
and you have
to wait 90 days.

175
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:13,239
But we've gone along
that statutory process.

176
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,708
And I will tell you, Tom,

177
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,411
you're going to see a lot
of additional relief

178
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,912
from these
horrible regulations

179
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,114
that have been
killing our country.

180
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,215
They've literally
been killing --

181
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,284
As you noticed, GDP was
just announced and --

182
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,886
shockingly to
a lot of people,

183
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,954
despite the hurricanes,

184
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,123
which possibly
could be considered

185
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,125
to be 1 point --

186
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,826
we were at 3.

187
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,295
And we were at 3.2
last quarter,

188
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,897
but we were at 3.

189
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,766
And to be at 3
with a 1 point,

190
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,435
that would have meant
we would have hit 4

191
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,770
or thereabouts.

192
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,138
And those are numbers

193
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,873
that have not been
seen for many years.

194
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,875
So we're doing well

195
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,676
and we'll continue
to do well.

196
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,145
The big thing is
we have companies

197
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,412
that really want
to move back

198
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,614
into
the United States now

199
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,815
because of regulation,

200
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,383
because of what
we're doing with taxes.

201
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,552
And some big ones
are going to be

202
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,320
announcing very soon.

203
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,189
Dirk, could I ask you
to say a few words

204
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,590
from the National
Association

205
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,526
of
Wholesale-Distributors?

206
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,693
That would be
great great.

207
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,195
Mr. Van Dongen: Firstly,
Mr. President, thank you.

208
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,864
I appreciate the
opportunity to be here.

209
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,500
A few of us in the room
are old enough

210
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,470
to remember being
in this same room

211
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,039
when President Reagan

212
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,208
was working
on the tax reform.

213
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,343
The two of us
were in this room.

214
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,444
The President: You don't
look that old.

215
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:26,612
(Laughter)

216
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,614
Mr. Van Dongen: Tom
was here.

217
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,683
(Laughter)

218
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,685
Thirty years or so
have passed.

219
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,954
The tax code
doesn't resemble

220
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,389
what was done in '86.

221
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,725
Reform was long,
long overdue.

222
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,695
I represent an industry

223
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,463
of very high
effective tax rates,

224
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,765
frankly, we're tired of paying

225
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,767
the other guys' taxes.

226
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,505
Unstated, but I assume
that the, kind of,

227
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,307
price of admission
for being here today

228
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,411
is that you support the
process moving forward.

229
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,547
And obviously each of us
have to see the details,

230
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,816
and there may be
one thing or another

231
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,351
that we'd like
to see different.

232
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,087
But the broader
perspective is that

233
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,722
for the good
of the economy,

234
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,091
the good of the country,
and, frankly,

235
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,659
I think, for the good
of our members,

236
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,430
you have to support the
process going forward.

237
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,834
You have our commitment
to do precisely that.

238
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,501
The President: That's
great.

239
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,336
Thank you, Dirk.

240
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,704
That's really great,
I appreciate it.

241
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,705
And I think so
important -- you know,

242
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,373
we talk tax cuts,

243
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,810
which is really, to me,
the very big thing --

244
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,645
the tax cuts.
We desperately need them.

245
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,080
But so many other things
are happening,

246
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,215
including bringing back
$4 trillion back

247
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,083
into the United States.

248
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,985
And that money is going
to be put to work

249
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,154
in our country,
for our people,

250
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,024
creating our jobs
and factories and plants.

251
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,859
I think the number

252
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,160
could be higher
than $4 trillion.

253
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,962
It s been $2.5 trillion
for so long.

254
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,364
Everyone said,
$2.5 trillion.

255
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,666
But it's gotten,
obviously, a lot bigger.

256
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,034
They just kept saying
$2.5 trillion.

257
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:55,902
I think the number
is going to be

258
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,904
well over $4 trillion --

259
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,206
will be coming back
into our country.

260
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,109
And so many other things.

261
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,510
One of the other elements

262
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,778
that are important,
Karen --

263
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,214
and you're going to say
a few words next

264
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,949
because I'm dying to hear
what you have to say.

265
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,184
But one of the things
so important

266
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,687
is simplification --
too complicated,

267
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,889
and we're
simplifying it greatly.

268
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,324
And I want to thank
all of my folks

269
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,893
for being here
and working on it --

270
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,895
Gary, Steve, everybody.

271
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,932
The process
is complicated,

272
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,200
but the end result will
not be that complicated.

273
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,135
It's going to be people

274
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,003
are going to pay
less tax by a lot.

275
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,440
Companies are going
to pay less tax by a lot.

276
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,309
That's a big difference.

277
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,245
And companies are going
to start rebuilding,

278
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,146
and they're
going to stay here.

279
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:40,980
And they're going
to expand,

280
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,949
and they're going to build
new plants in this country.

281
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,051
They won't be going
to other countries like

282
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,819
they have been
for many, many decades.

283
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,621
Karen, could you say
few words?

284
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,990
Small Business,
Entrepreneurship Council?

285
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,424
Ms. Kerrigan: Sure.

286
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,960
Well, thank you so much,
Mr. President,

287
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,496
for your support and
leadership on this issue.

288
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,866
This is really one of
the most critical issues

289
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,535
for small business.

290
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,004
And they know if they
get tax reform through,

291
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,505
they're going to have
more capital

292
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,874
to put back into
their businesses.

293
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,476
They're going
to invest more.

294
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,412
They're going to provide
higher wages,

295
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,047
better benefits
for their employees.

296
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,116
These business owners
and entrepreneurs

297
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,051
are also leaders
of the community

298
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,653
back
in their communities.

299
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,655
And they do see
the lack of dynamism,

300
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,290
the lack of
business dynamism.

301
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,792
They don't see
new business creation

302
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,526
in their communities,

303
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,095
and that's a really
serious problem

304
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:29,462
in this country --

305
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,062
The President: Right.

306
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,030
Ms. Kerrigan: -- the lack
of entrepreneurship,

307
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,964
weak entrepreneurship.

308
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,599
According to our numbers,

309
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,203
3.2 million missing
businesses in our country

310
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,904
because of people
not taking risks.

311
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,772
The President: Right.

312
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:43,009
Ms. Kerrigan: So, we're
very excited about tax reform

313
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,378
in terms of the growth
it will bring,

314
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,379
the investment
it will bring,

315
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,583
making the U.S. a haven
for capital again

316
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,452
because we need
to get that edge back

317
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:54,720
and need to encourage

318
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,921
more people
to start businesses --

319
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,656
particularly millennials

320
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:58,524
starting
businesses again.

321
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,358
The President: Right,
that's true.

322
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,426
Ms. Kerrigan: Which is
going to add to, again,

323
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,328
our competitiveness,
so, thank you.

324
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,729
The President: One of the
things that we've been

325
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,731
talking about
and that we've seen

326
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,299
and there's been
anything like it

327
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,735
is the level
of enthusiasm --

328
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,303
the enthusiasm
for business,

329
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,538
for manufacturing.

330
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,040
It's the highest level
it's ever been --

331
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,876
highest level since
the charts started.

332
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,445
And we have
a tremendous level

333
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,247
now of enthusiasm
for business

334
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,715
and for manufacturing.

335
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,617
And nobody has ever
seen anything like it.

336
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,752
And of course,
the stock market

337
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,522
is at an all-time high --
historic high.

338
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,224
There's never been --
I mean, it's going up --

339
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,394
I think it was 54 times
since I was elected;

340
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,696
we've hit the record
54 times.

341
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,565
And I notice it's up
again a little bit today,

342
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,466
so that's always good.

343
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,867
But we're going to try
and keep it going up.

344
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,805
But we've created
almost $5.5 trillion

345
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,907
in stock market wealth.

346
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,342
Think of that --
$5.5 trillion

347
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,344
since November 8th.

348
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,979
So, we're very honored
by all of that.

349
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,581
But a very big part of it

350
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,084
will be tax cuts
and tax reform,

351
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,285
and we'll work
on that together.

352
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,719
Thank you all very much.

353
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,854
Thank you.
