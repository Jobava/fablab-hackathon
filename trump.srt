1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
The President: Station this is your President.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,240
Do you hear me?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,545
NASA: Station, this is Houston are you ready for the event?

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,680
Station: Yes, we're ready for the event.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,018
NASA: White House, this is
Mission Control, Houston.

6
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:22,288
Please call Station
for a voice check.

7
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,623
The President:
Do you hear me?

8
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:30,997
Cmdr. Whitson: Yes, sir.

9
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,500
We have you
loud and clear.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,634
The President: Well,
that's what we like --

11
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,138
great American
equipment that works.

12
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,305
And this isn't easy.

13
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,574
(Laughter.)

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,948
I want to say it's very exciting to be here today

15
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,017
-- very, very
exciting -- and to speak

16
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,721
to you live with three
brave American astronauts.

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,723
These are our finest.

18
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,894
These are great, great
Americans, great people.

19
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,997
Two join us from orbit
aboard the

20
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:09,602
International Space Station: Commander Peggy Whitson and

21
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,738
Colonel Jack Fischer.

22
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,742
And Peggy Whitson has been
setting records, and we're

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,111
going to talk about
that very soon.

24
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,913
I'm here in the Oval
Office, along with my

25
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,384
daughter Ivanka and
astronaut Kate Rubins, who

26
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:28,688
recently returned from space and from the Space Station.

27
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,892
Together, we are being
joined by students all

28
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:37,630
across America, thousands
and thousands of students

29
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,532
who are learning --
they're learning about

30
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,602
space, learning about a
lot of other things -- and

31
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,639
they're watching this conversation from the classroom.

32
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,677
And, all over, we have
astronauts and we have

33
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,112
everybody, who are flying
right now,

34
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:56,816
17,000 miles per hour.

35
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,551
That's about as fast
as I've ever heard.

36
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,855
I wouldn't want to be
flying 17,000 miles an hour.

37
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,756
But that's what you do.

38
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,992
Peggy, Jack, and Kate,
I know that America's

39
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,928
students are thrilled
to hear from you.

40
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,663
But first, I want to
say that this is a very

41
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,866
special day in the
glorious history of

42
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,035
American spaceflight.

43
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:20,573
Today, Commander Whitson,
you have broken the record

44
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,176
for the most total time
spent in space by an

45
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:29,282
American astronaut --
534 days and counting.

46
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,051
That's an incredible
record to break.

47
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,421
And on behalf of our
nation and, frankly, on

48
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,125
behalf of the world, I'd
like to congratulate you.

49
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,227
That is really something.

50
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,063
And I'd like to know,
how does it feel to have

51
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,566
broken such a big and
important record?

52
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:54,707
Cmdr. Whitson: Well, it's
actually a huge honor to

53
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,844
break a record like this,
but it's an honor for me

54
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,947
basically to be
representing all the folks

55
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:05,285
at NASA who make this
spaceflight possible and

56
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,922
who make me setting
this record feasible.

57
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,258
And so it's a very
exciting time to be at NASA.

58
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,461
We are all very much
looking forward, as

59
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,299
directed by your new NASA
bill -- we're excited

60
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,235
about the missions
to Mars in the 2030s.

61
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,104
And so we actually,
physically, have hardware

62
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,641
on the ground that's being
built for the SLS rocket

63
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,243
that's going to
take us there.

64
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,745
And, of course, the
hardware being built now

65
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,614
is going to be for the
test flights that will

66
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,215
eventually get us there.

67
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,017
But it's a very exciting
time, and I'm so

68
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,420
proud of the team.

69
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,154
The President: Great.

70
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,656
And what are we learning
from having you spending

71
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,624
your time up there?

72
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,826
I know so much research
is done; I'm getting a

73
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,429
glimpse of some of it
right here in the Oval Office.

74
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,131
What are we learning
by being in space?

75
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:59,472
Cmdr. Whitson: Well, I think
probably the International

76
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:04,444
Space Station is providing
a key bridge from us

77
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,982
living on Earth to going
somewhere into deep space.

78
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,217
So on those Mars missions,
we need to better

79
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,219
understand how
microgravity is really

80
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,221
affecting our body, and we
need to understand

81
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,221
it in great detail.

82
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:19,091
So, many of the studies
are looking at the human body.

83
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:22,795
We're also looking at
things that involve

84
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,732
operations of a space
vehicles on these

85
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,534
long-duration missions
and the technological

86
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,004
advancements that
will be required.

87
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,773
For instance, on a
multiyear Mars mission,

88
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,275
we're going to need to be
able to close the life

89
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,412
support system, and that
means we, right now, for

90
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:43,349
instance, are taking solar
power that we collect, and

91
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,986
using it to break apart
water into oxygen and hydrogen.

92
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,655
The oxygen, we
breathe, of course.

93
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,823
We use the hydrogen,
combine it back with the

94
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:55,461
CO2 that we take out of
the air, and make more water.

95
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,165
But water is such a
precious resource up here

96
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:03,136
that we also are cleaning
up our urine and

97
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,170
making it drinkable.

98
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,406
And it's really not
as bad as it sounds.

99
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,975
The President:
Well, that's good.

100
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,575
I'm glad to hear that.

101
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,576
(Laughter.)

102
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,178
Better you than me.

103
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,181
I will say, Colonel
Fischer, you just arrived,

104
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,983
and how was your trip?

105
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,784
Complicated?

106
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,451
Easy?

107
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,686
How did it go?

108
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,559
Col. Fischer: Oh, sir,
it was awesome.

109
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,930
It made even my beloved
F-22 feel a little

110
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,131
bit underpowered.

111
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,803
I launched in a Russian
vehicle with my Russian

112
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:41,708
friend, Fyodor Yurchikhin,
from Kazakhstan.

113
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,911
Got the immediate
perspective change as we

114
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,814
got to orbit, and I saw
that frail, thin blue line

115
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,315
of life around the Earth.

116
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,051
Six hours later, we're
docked at the station.

117
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:56,322
The next day, I install an
experiment in the Japanese

118
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,625
module that's going to be
looking at new drugs and

119
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,361
how we can make those
drugs for muscular

120
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,031
dystrophy, Alzheimer's,
multi-drug-resistant

121
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,767
bacteria -- all
sorts of things.

122
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,137
A couple hours later, I
watched our crewmate,

123
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,373
Thomas Pesquet, a
Frenchman, drive a

124
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:18,010
Canadian robotic arm to
capture a spaceship from

125
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,582
Virginia, carrying 3.5
tons of cargo and science

126
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,784
that's going to keep us
busy for the next few

127
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,986
months, and dock
that to the station.

128
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,455
Sir, it's amazing.

129
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,524
Oh, and then, you know,
now I'm talking to the

130
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,361
President of the United States while hanging from a wall.

131
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,496
It's amazing.

132
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,932
The International Space
Station is, by far, the

133
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,435
best example of
international cooperation

134
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,137
and what we can do when
we work together in the

135
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,172
history of humanity.

136
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:50,743
And I am so proud
to be a part of it.

137
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,445
And it's just cool.

138
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,613
(Laughter.)

139
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,282
Like, yesterday, I had -- well,

140
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,952
there you go -- there's
our resident space ninja

141
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,156
doing the gravity
demonstration.

142
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,692
And yesterday morning, I
had my coffee in floaty

143
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:10,463
ball form, and, sir,
it was delicious.

144
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,600
So, it's awesome.

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,868
The President: Tell me,
Mars -- what do you see a

146
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,237
timing for actually
sending humans to Mars?

147
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,872
Is there a schedule?

148
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,275
And when would you
see that happening?

149
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:27,246
Cmdr. Whitson: Well, I think as
your bill directed, it

150
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,084
will be approximately
in the 2030s.

151
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,921
As I mentioned, we
actually are building

152
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,357
hardware to test the new
heavy launch vehicle, and

153
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,560
this vehicle will take us
further than we've ever

154
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,263
been away from
this planet.

155
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,499
Unfortunately, spaceflight
takes a lot of time and

156
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,136
money, so getting there
will require some

157
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,739
international cooperation
to get it to be a

158
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,176
planet-wide approach
in order to make it

159
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,278
successful, just because
it is a very

160
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,813
expensive endeavor.

161
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,815
But it so
worthwhile doing.

162
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,384
The President: Well, we
want to try and do it

163
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:09,055
during my first term or,
at worst, during my second term.

164
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,257
So we'll have to speed
that up a little bit, okay?

165
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:17,563
Cmdr. Whitson: (Laughter.)
We'll do our best.

166
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,965
The President:
Oh, you will.

167
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,400
And I have great
respect for you folks.

168
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,702
It's amazing what you do.

169
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,504
And I just want to
introduce another great one.

170
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:28,975
Kate Rubins is with us
today, and she has been so

171
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,345
impressive with research
and so many other things

172
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,046
having to do with NASA.

173
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,816
And, Kate, I understand
you're the first person to

174
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,985
sequence DNA in space.

175
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,519
Can you tell
us about that?

176
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,087
Dr. Rubins: Yeah.

177
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,389
So that was actually just
this last summer, and it's

178
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,125
a real example of what we
can do with technology

179
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,360
and innovation.

180
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,562
We've got a sequencer
down to the size of your

181
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,064
cellphone, and we were
actually able to fly that

182
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,767
onboard the space station
and sequence DNA.

183
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,602
It's not just the
technology demonstration,

184
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,605
but we can actually use
that to do things like

185
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,641
detect microbes on the
space station, look

186
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,075
at astronaut health.

187
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,078
We can easily use that in
Earth-based settings, too,

188
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,781
to look for disease
outbreaks and to do rural

189
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,749
healthcare as well.

190
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,317
The President:
That's fantastic.

191
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,151
That is really great.

192
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,853
I saw some of the work,
and it's incredible.

193
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,388
You know, I've been
dealing with politicians

194
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,624
so much, I'm so much more
impressed with these people.

195
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,293
You have no idea.

196
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,561
Now, speaking of another
impressive person --

197
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:26,332
Ivanka, you've been very
much interested in this program.

198
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,400
Tell us something
about it.

199
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,068
Ms. Trump: Hi,
Dr. Whitson.

200
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,337
First of all,
congratulations on your

201
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,506
incredible
milestone today.

202
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,641
You may know that my
father recently signed the

203
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,778
Inspire Women Act
to encourage female

204
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,281
participation in STEM
fields across all

205
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:47,853
aerospace areas, and
really with a focus on NASA.

206
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,723
So encouraging women and
girls to pursue STEM

207
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,125
careers is a major priority for this administration.

208
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,463
And today we are sitting
with an amazing example of

209
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,232
that -- Dr. Rubins,
and you, Dr. Whitson.

210
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,035
So I would love to hear
from you, what was the

211
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,271
impetus for you to get
involved in the sciences?

212
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,809
Dr. Rubins: Yeah, so
when I around fifteen, I

213
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:14,847
actually went to a
conference, and that was

214
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:15,881
very inspiring for me.

215
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,984
It was sort of the
beginning of recombinant

216
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,720
DNA and understanding
biology.

217
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,656
And so just that exposure
to scientists and the

218
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,591
kinds of things that you
can do with science and

219
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,393
technology innovation.

220
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,429
Ms. Trump: Amazing.

221
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,465
Dr. Whitson?

222
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,402
Cmdr. Whitson: For me, it was
actually the Apollo

223
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:39,572
program was my
inspiration, and that was

224
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,874
when it became a dream
to become an astronaut.

225
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,243
But I don't really think
it became a goal until I

226
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,012
graduated from high
school, when the first

227
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,247
female astronauts
were selected.

228
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,016
And seeing those role
models, and with the

229
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,752
encouragement of my
parents and various

230
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,155
mentors in college and
graduate school, and when

231
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,191
I started working at
Rice, that's what made it

232
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,927
possible, I think, to
become an astronaut.

233
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,063
And it took me a lot
longer to become an

234
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,832
astronaut than I ever
really wanted it to take,

235
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,668
but I do think I'm better
at my job because

236
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,403
of the journey.

237
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:13,472
Ms. Trump: You're an incredible inspiration to us all.

238
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,809
So I would also like to
ask you one more question.

239
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:20,112
I'm incredibly curious, as
I'm sure all the students

240
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,949
across the country are,
to know what a day in the

241
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,518
life in space is like.

242
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,586
Could you share what a
typical day looks like,

243
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:31,157
what the challenges are,
just any special moments?

244
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:36,162
Cmdr. Whitson: Well, a typical
day, we wake up and look

245
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,134
at the messages from the
ground, because we have a

246
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,004
huge ground team that's
working overnight to

247
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:49,208
prepare changes or the
details of the tests that

248
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,609
we're going to be
performing over the

249
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:51,343
course of the day.

250
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,913
So first thing I do is
check out that,

251
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,548
see what's changed.

252
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,417
But on any given day, it can be so dramatically different.

253
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,686
On one day, we might be
focusing on science.

254
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,988
On another day, we might
be repairing the carbon

255
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,824
dioxide removal system.

256
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,826
On another day, soon Jack
and I are going

257
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,195
to do a spacewalk.

258
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,330
We talked about, last
Saturday, we did

259
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,632
robotics operations.

260
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,701
I love the diversity of
the different

261
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,236
activities that we do.

262
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,072
Plus, you know, we have
over 200 investigations

263
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,908
ongoing onboard the space
station, and I just think

264
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,910
that's a phenomenal
part of the day.

265
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,013
Of course, there's also
just the living and,

266
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,484
onboard the space station,
it's such a unique and

267
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,718
novel environment.

268
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,287
Nothing that we're
used to on the ground.

269
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,991
And it's so special to
just be in zero gravity.

270
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,694
So Jack is the new guy
here, and I think he can

271
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,463
probably give you a better perspective on what that's like.

272
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:49,468
Col. Fischer: Well, you know,
everything here -- my dad

273
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,706
always said that if you
love what you do, you

274
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,407
never work a day
in your life.

275
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:57,676
And we work really hard up
here, but it's not really

276
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,744
work, it's just fun.

277
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,514
It's like playing fort
almost, only you're

278
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,782
changing the world
while you do it.

279
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:07,520
And then on the off time,
the other morning I was

280
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,023
working out, and on our
machine that we work out

281
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,459
on, right below it
is the Cupola window.

282
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,097
And so when you're on
the device where you do

283
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,199
crunches, every time you
come up,

284
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,333
you see out the window.

285
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,170
And it's awesome because
you kind of go, crunch,

286
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,071
"Oh, my gosh,
that's beautiful!

287
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,040
I got to do that again."
Crunch, "Oh my gosh,

288
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,909
that's beautiful."
It's awesome.

289
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,479
Everything we do here is
fun, and it feels so great

290
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,081
to know that we're making
a difference on the ground

291
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,117
and for the future
of humanity as well.

292
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:42,021
So it's an incredible,
incredible job.

293
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,758
The President: You're
making a great difference,

294
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,592
I have to say.

295
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,061
And this is a very
exciting time for our

296
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,397
country, and you see
what's happening with our

297
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:55,534
country in terms of jobs,
in terms of business, and

298
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:59,205
there's such excitement
and such enthusiasm.

299
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,473
Many American
entrepreneurs are

300
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,608
racing into space.

301
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,377
I have many friends that
are so excited about space.

302
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,746
They want to get involved
in space from the

303
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,683
standpoint of
entrepreneurship and business.

304
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,751
Tell us about the
opportunities that could

305
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,589
exist for the next
generation of scientists

306
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,489
and engineers.

307
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,492
Is that something that you
think a student -- because

308
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,861
you have so many students,
hundreds of thousands

309
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,164
watching -- is that
something that you think

310
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,066
that students should be
focusing, or should they

311
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,134
be thinking about
other subjects?

312
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,804
What do you think are the
opportunities for young

313
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,406
students wanting to
be involved in space?

314
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:39,411
Col. Fischer: Sir, absolutely.

315
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:45,451
I think that this is
probably the most exciting

316
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,153
in space exploration,
certainly in my lifetime.

317
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:53,592
We are about to just have
an explosion of activity.

318
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,595
There is so much
involvement on the space

319
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,064
station with commercial
industries and

320
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,165
commercial partners.

321
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:05,004
We have an entire program
to manage the science.

322
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,973
NASA has done a wonderful
job of seeding a new

323
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,110
industry with the
Commercial Crew Program

324
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,079
and the Commercial Cargo
Program so that we can

325
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,181
build the infrastructure
we need for the

326
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,549
future exploration.

327
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:21,453
One thing I love about
American entrepreneurs is,

328
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,822
once you get them going,
you better stand out of

329
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,925
their way because they're
going to start chucking.

330
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,494
And we're about
to that point.

331
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:33,832
NASA is taking on that
expensive, hard, complex

332
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,169
task of going further and
deeper into space with the

333
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:41,774
wonderful new rocket,
Space Launch System and Orion.

334
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:46,945
And then, as soon as we
break open that door, this

335
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,715
incredible infrastructure
that we've been building

336
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,985
is going to be right there
to pick up the baton and

337
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,720
continue into the stars.

338
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,622
I would say to all
the students that are

339
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,792
watching, the time to
get excited is now.

340
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,195
If you aren't studying
science and math, you

341
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:07,700
might want to think about
that because our future in

342
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,304
the stars starts now, and
you can be a part of that

343
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:16,408
if, like Dr. Whitson, you
can find that passion and

344
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,910
work really hard.

345
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,780
And we're going to find a
permanent foothold in the

346
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,483
stars for humanity
if you do that.

347
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,884
The President:
Well, thank you.

348
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,119
So well said.

349
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,621
And I have to say, there's
tremendous military

350
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,857
application in space.

351
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:35,494
We're rebuilding our
military like never before.

352
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,730
We're ordering equipment,
and we're going to have

353
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,566
the strongest military
that we've ever had, the

354
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,735
strongest military that
the world has ever seen,

355
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,371
and there's been no time
where we need it more.

356
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,573
And I'm sure that every
student watching wants to

357
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,776
know, what is next for
Americans in space.

358
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,113
I'm very proud that I just
signed a bill committing

359
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:58,183
NASA to the aim of sending
America astronauts to Mars.

360
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,418
So we'll do that.

361
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,521
I think we'll do it a lot
sooner than we're even thinking.

362
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,556
So which one of you is
ready to go to Mars?

363
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,523
Are you ready?

364
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:06,958
And I think you're ready.

365
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,493
I know you're
ready, right?

366
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:09,594
We just discussed that.

367
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,064
She'd like to go to
Mars very quickly.

368
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:13,799
Who's ready to go
to Mars up there?

369
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,804
Cmdr. Whitson: We are absolutely
ready to go to Mars.

370
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,175
It's going to be a
fantastic journey getting

371
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,744
there, and very exciting
times, and all of us

372
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,079
would be happy to go.

373
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,616
But I want all the young
people out there to

374
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,385
recognize that the real
steps are going to be

375
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,120
taken in a few years.

376
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,690
And so by studying math,
science, engineering, any

377
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,560
kind of technology, you're
going to have a part in

378
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,529
that, and that will
be very exciting.

379
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,697
The President: I just want
to thank you very much.

380
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:49,968
And, Dr. Whitson, I just
-- congratulations.

381
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:50,636
Amazing.

382
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,440
What an amazing thing
that you've done.

383
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,875
Everybody here -- I know
you're family -- but

384
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,845
everybody here is
incredibly proud of the

385
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,813
record you just broke.

386
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,815
I hope that every young
American watching today

387
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:07,419
finds, in your example, a
reason to love space and

388
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,655
think about space because
many great things are

389
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,891
going to come out,
tremendous discoveries in

390
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,793
medicine and so
many other fields.

391
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,762
So thank you very much.

392
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,765
I want to say God bless
you, God bless America.

393
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,135
We are very, very proud
of you, and very proud

394
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:23,836
of your bravery.

395
00:18:23,836 --> 00:00:00,000
Thank you very much.
